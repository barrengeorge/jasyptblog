This is a repository of source code for my blog [HOW TO ENCRYPT DECRYPT A PASSWORD STORED IN A PROPERTIES FILE WITH JAVA + JASYPT + APACHE COMMONS CONFIGURATION] (http://www.sortedset.com/how-to-encrypt-decrypt-a-password-stored-in-a-properties-file-with-java-jasypt-apache-commons-configuration/)

This project is configured a little different from the blog that was written a few years back. This project uses Maven for easy dependency management.

## How to Test

- Clone the project
- You must have maven installed.
- Run the project
  ```
  > mvn clean package
  ```
